At the moment, this code combines three sensors working in unison. 
Namely, mlx90614 (Non-contact Temperature Sensor), adxl345 (Digital Accelerometer) and max90100 (Heart Rate + Blood Oxygen Level). 
First, Arduino IDE should be downloaded to run this code.

**Note**: RTC, GSR Sensor, Vibration sensor, Battery Management and non-invasive glucose monitoring are to be added to this project in the next semester.
